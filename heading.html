    <h3>QUOTES</h3>
    <blockquote cite="quotesgram.com">If there's empty spaces in your heart,They'll make you think it's wrong,Like having empty spaces,Means you can never be strong.But I've learnt that all these spaces,Means there's room enough to grow,And the people that once filled them,Were always meant to be let go.All these empty spaces,Create a strange sort of pull,That attract so many people,You wouldn't meet if they were full.So if you're made of empty spaces,Don't ever think its wrong,Because maybe they're just empty,Until the right person comes along.</blockquote>
